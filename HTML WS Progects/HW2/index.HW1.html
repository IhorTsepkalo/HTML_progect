        <p class="box"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> considers Louis de Funes as a
            "France's favourite actor – having played over 150 roles in
            film and over 100 on stage. His acting style is remembered for its high-energy performance and his wide range of
            facial expressions and tics. A considerable part of his best-known acting was directed by Jean Girault.
            Louis de Funès is one of the most famous French actors of all time, and even more so when it comes to his
            international celebrity" </p>

            <div class="box6">
                Louis de Funès was born on 31 July 1914 in Courbevoie, Hauts-de-Seine to parents who hailed from Seville, Spain. Since the
                couple's families opposed their marriage, they eloped to France in 1904. His father, Carlos Luis de Funès de Galarza, a nobleman whose mother
                descended from the Counts de Galarza (of Basque origin).[3] His father was from Funes.[4] He had been a lawyer in Spain, but became a diamond
                cutter upon arriving in France. His mother, Leonor Soto Reguera, was Galician, daughter to Galician lawyer Teolindo Soto Barro, of Portuguese
                descent. During the occupation of Paris in the Second World War, he continued his piano studies at a music school, where he fell in love with a
                secretary, Jeanne Barthelémy de Maupassant. She had fallen in love with "the young man who played jazz like God"; they married in 1943 and
                remained together for forty years until de Funès' death in 1983. They had two sons: Patrick (born on 27 January 1944, who became a doctor) and
                Olivier (born on 11 August 1949, who became a pilot for Air France Europe and also followed his father in the acting profession). Olivier de
                Funès became known for the roles he played in some of his father's films (Les Grandes Vacances, Fantômas se déchaîne, Le Grand Restaurant and
                Hibernatus being the most famous).
                The filmografy of this famost actor includes about 150 movies. Most of them were comedies.
                In 1945, thanks to his contact with Daniel Gélin, de Funès made his film debut at the age of 31 with a bit part in Jean Stelli's La Tentation de
                Barbizon.[5] He appears on screen for less than 40 seconds in the role of the porter of the cabaret Le Paradis, welcoming the character played
                by Jérôme Chambon in the entrance hall and pointing him to the double doors leading to the main room, saying: "C'est par ici, Monsieur" ("It's
                this way, Sir"). Chambon declines the invitation, pushing the door himself instead of pulling it open. De Funès then says: "Bien, il a son
                compte celui-là, aujourd'hui!" ("Well, he had enough, today!").[6]
                He went on to perform in 130 film roles over the next 20 years, playing minor roles in over 80 films before being offered his first leading
                roles. During this period, de Funès developed a daily routine of professional activities: in the morning he did dubbing for recognized artists
                such as Totò, an Italian comic of the time; during the afternoon he worked in film; and in the evening, he performed as a theatre actor.
                From 1945 to 1955, he appeared in 50 films, usually as an extra or walk-on. In 1954, he went on to star in such films as Ah! Les belles
                bacchantes and Le Mouton à cinq pattes. A break came in 1956, when he appeared as the black-market pork butcher Jambier (another small role) in
                Claude Autant-Lara's well-known World War II comedy, La Traversée de Paris. He achieved stardom in 1963 with Jean Girault's film, Pouic-Pouic.
                This successful film guaranteed de Funès top billing in all of his subsequent films. At the age of 49, de Funès unexpectedly became a major star
                of international renown with the success of Le gendarme de Saint-Tropez. After their first successful collaboration, director Jean Girault
                perceived de Funès as the ideal actor to play the part of the scheming, opportunistic and sycophant gendarme; the first film, therefore, led to
                a series of six.
                Another collaboration with director Gérard Oury produced a memorable tandem of de Funès with Bourvil—another great comic actor—in the 1964 film,
                Le Corniaud. The success of the de Funès-Bourvil partnership was repeated two years later in La Grande Vadrouille, one of the most successful
                and the largest grossing film ever made in France, drawing an audience of 17.27 million. It remains his greatest success.[7] Oury envisaged a
                further reunion of the two comics in his film La Folie des grandeurs, but Bourvil's death in 1970 led to the unlikely pairing of de Funès with
                Yves Montand in that film.
                Louis de Funès on the set of L'homme orchestre, in 1970.
                Eventually, he became France's leading comic actor. Between 1964 and 1979, he topped France's box-office of the year's most successful movies
                seven times. In 1968, all three of his films were in the top ten in France for the year, topped by Le Petit Baigneur.[8]
                He co-starred with many of the major French actors of his time, including Jean Marais and Mylène Demongeot in the Fantomas trilogy, and also
                Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Coluche, Annie Girardot, and Yves Montand. He also worked with Jean Girault in the famous 'Gendarmes' series. In a
                departure from the Gendarme image, de Funès collaborated with Claude Zidi, who wrote for him a new character full of nuances and frankness in
                L'aile ou la cuisse (1976), which is arguably the best of his roles. Later, de Funès' considerable musical abilities were showcased in films
                such as Le Corniaud and Le Grand Restaurant. In 1964, he debuted in the first of the Fantômas series, which launched him into superstardom.
                In 1975, Oury turned again to de Funès for a film entitled Le Crocodile', in which he was to play the role of a South American dictator. But in
                March 1975, de Funès was hospitalized for heart problems and forced to take a rest from acting, causing Le Crocodile to be cancelled. After his
                recovery, he appeared opposite another comic genius, Coluche, in L'Aile ou la cuisse. In 1980, de Funès realised a long-standing dream to make a
                film version of Molière's play, L'Avare.
                Louis de Funès made his final film, Le Gendarme et les gendarmettes in 1982.
